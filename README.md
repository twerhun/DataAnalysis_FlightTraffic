# DataAnalysis_FlightTraffic
Mapping flight patterns and high aircraft density areas in Poland.

Flight Traffic project symulates typical flight routes and tendencies with a specified time period, modelling sky traffic above Poland. Data, gathered from FlightRadar24 site via dedicated python library, was grouped into clusters on a specified grid, and presented as heat maps. Additional information gathered by api was presented on charts, comparing and evaluating polish voivodeships based on selected factors.

Topics explored in this project:
- gathering geolocation data via filghtradar24 api
- grouping data into grid clusters
- data visualisation on heat maps
- data analysis and interpretation

Libraries and tools:
- pandas
- geopandas
- numpy
- time
- shapely
- shapefile
- FlightRadar24
- matplotlib
- scipy
